Put your lua script in here, replace it to update it.

Use the ScriptEventFunc to have events run when things happen like when a falling gameobject hits a button, etc.

THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE SCRIPT!!! 
PLEASE DON'T YELL AT US!!!

Delete the script if you do not plan on using scripts.

Have fun modders!
